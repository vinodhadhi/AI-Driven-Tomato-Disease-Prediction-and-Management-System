# ðŸŒ¿ AI-driven Crop Disease Prediction and Management System

This project presents an AI-powered tool to detect and classify **tomato plant diseases** from leaf images using a fine-tuned **EfficientNetB0** model. It features a lightweight **Streamlit interface** for real-time predictions and can be deployed locally or in the cloud.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Deep learning model (EfficientNetB0) trained on PlantVillage dataset
- Streamlit web interface for real-time disease detection
- Grad-CAM heatmaps for model explainability
- Optimized for mobile and low-resource environments
- Supports offline usage and geotagged logging

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- Model: EfficientNetB0 (Transfer Learning)
- Input Size: 224x224
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss: Categorical Crossentropy
- Accuracy: ~98.3% on test data
