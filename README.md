# ðŸŒ¿ AI-driven Crop Disease Prediction and Management System

This project presents an AI-powered tool to detect and classify **tomato plant diseases** from leaf images using a fine-tuned **EfficientNetB0** model. It features a lightweight **Streamlit interface** for real-time predictions and can be deployed locally or in the cloud.

## ðŸš€ Features

- EfficientNetB0 transfer learning model
- Streamlit app for real-time image classification
- Grad-CAM explainability (optional)
- Optimized for mobile/low-bandwidth use
- Offline support

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

- `app/`: Streamlit app and model
- `notebooks/`: Model training code
